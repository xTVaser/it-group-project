# Internet Tools Group Assignment Two
## How we will work Together
We will need to talk over hangouts or something to decide what we want it to look like and make essentially a template for the main page.
At this point we can all work on individual pages or whatever.  

Use the issue tracker extensively to say what needs to be done or improved. Do some work, as you come up with ideas or after you are done, make issues of them so we don't forget.
## Description of Task
Develop a single mocked-up prototype of an **Individual Faculty MEMBER profile page** for Algoma University.  

Not exactly the same, but modeled off of Simon Fraser University
